# Crystal Collector

This is a fun number guessing game made with JQuery.

A random number will appear on page load.

You click any of the 4 crystals to add a specific (but random) number of points to your total. You will not know many points each crystal is untill you click on it.

You will the game by matching your points to the random number.
You lose if your points are greater than the random number.

After each win or loss the game resets while keeping track of your wins and losses.

Start the game and have fun!
